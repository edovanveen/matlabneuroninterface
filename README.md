# NEURON Toolbox
Interface for connecting NEURON and MATLAB.

This main branch is intended to connect the two tools at a low level (C/C++) and avoid any third-party dependencies (e.g. work here will not require Python).

A separate branch, [using-python](https://github.com/mcdougallab/matlabneuroninterface/tree/using-python) at this point is more complete (in that it has an interface that can be used to generate an action potential) but it does the connection via Python.
